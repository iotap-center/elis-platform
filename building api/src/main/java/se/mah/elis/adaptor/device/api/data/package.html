This package provides various data interfaces. They range from status messages
and identifiers to samples and measurements.

<p>
The samples make up a special part of this package. They are time-stamped data
objects containing data collected by special a special class of sensors, called
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Sampler}s. The
samplers will mark each sample with a timestamp upon creation, and will also
leave a note regarding the duration of the sample. Thus, samples can be used as
a mean of encapsulating historical data regarding energy usage, indoor climate,
etc.
