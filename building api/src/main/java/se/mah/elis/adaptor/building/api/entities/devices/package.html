This package provides all device types that are supported by the Elis platform.

<p>
Every single device is descended from the {@link Device} base interface. They
are then divided into two categories: {@link Sensor}s and {@link Actuator}s.
The key difference between the two is that a sensor device <i>measures</i> its
environment, whereas an actuator <i>manipulates</i> it. The sensor class of
devices is further divided into the two {@link Detector} and {@link Sampler}
interfaces, which provide functionality for sampling and event creation. Note
that there are some sensors that fall outside of any of those two categories.
Furthermore, a device can be both a sensor and an actuator. This is reflected
in the API, where for example the {@link Thermostat} interface extends both the
{@link Thermometer}, which is a sensor, and the {@link Actuator} interfaces. As
is the case with all interfaces, any implementation of those interfaces can
choose freely what interfaces to implement, giving way for multi-capable
devices.
</p>

<p>
However, the above isn't entirely true. The {@link Gateway} interface, that is
used to describe a gateway device isn't considered a device on its own merits.
Instead, it is considered a special case of a {@link DeviceSet}, with some
extra information regarding addressing, identification and so on. In the case
where an actual gateway has sensory or actuating capabilities, the proper
implementation of such a gateway object would have to implement the gateway
class as both a {@link Device} and a {@link Gateway}.
</p>

<p>
Also provided in this package are various auxiliary interfaces, that can be
used as capabilities to the device objects. One such example is the
{@link BatteryEquipped} interface.
