This package provides various events triggered by some sensor devices. The
events are all descended from the {@link DetectorEvent} base class.

<p>
DetectorEvents are consumed by {@link NotificationConsumer} objects, and make
up the base of the semi-real time communication layer between {@link Detector}
objects and other parts of the platform.
