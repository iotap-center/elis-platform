This package provides various events triggered by some sensor devices. The
events are all descended from the
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.events.DetectorEvent} base class.

<p>
DetectorEvents are consumed by {@link NotificationConsumer} objects, and make
up the base of the semi-real time communication layer between
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Detector} objects and
other parts of the platform.
