What is this?

  The Water service component exposes the water metering functionality to the
  REST API as the /water/ endpoint.
  
How does it work?

  The endpoint services are annotated with Java's JAX-RS annotations. By doing
  so, the Elis platform's embedded Jersey server will then automatically
  recognize the exposed services as being web services and expose them to the
  outside world.
