This package provides all device types that are supported by the Elis platform.

<p>
Every single device is descended from the
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Device} base
interface. They are then divided into two categories:
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Sensor}s and
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Actuator}s.
The key difference between the two is that a sensor device <i>measures</i> its
environment, whereas an actuator <i>manipulates</i> it. The sensor class of
devices is further divided into the two
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Detector} and
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Sampler} interfaces,
which provide functionality for sampling and event creation. Note that there
are some sensors that fall outside of any of those two categories. Furthermore,
a device can be both a sensor and an actuator. This is reflected in the API,
where for example the
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Thermostat} interface
extends both the
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Thermometer}, which is
a sensor, and the
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Actuator} interfaces.
As is the case with all interfaces, any implementation of those interfaces can
choose freely what interfaces to implement, giving way for multi-capable
devices.
</p>

<p>
However, the above isn't entirely true. The
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Gateway} interface,
that is used to describe a gateway device isn't considered a device on its own
merits. Instead, it is considered a special case of a
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.DeviceSet}, with some
extra information regarding addressing, identification and so on. In the case
where an actual gateway has sensory or actuating capabilities, the proper
implementation of such a gateway object would have to implement the gateway
class as both a
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Device} and a
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.Gateway}.
</p>

<p>
Also provided in this package are various auxiliary interfaces, that can be
used as capabilities to the device objects. One such example is the
{@link se.mah.elis.adaptor.building.api.entities.devices.BatteryEquipped}
interface.
