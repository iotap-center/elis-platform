/**
 * <p>Query is used to look for data objects in the Elis storage. It makes use
 * of self references for method chaining. A Query will always return full
 * objects, as opposed to proper database systems, where the user can freely
 * choose what fields to return. Also, in its current incarnation, a Query
 * can't join several data object types in a nice manner. The data retrieved
 * from the storage will be returned as oldest-first by default, meaning that
 * if the user runs a query limited by start = 1, size = 1, the object returned
 * will always be the oldest.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Please note, that the query will never return data that isn't visible to
 * the user performing the query.</p>
