<p>The Elis Persistent Query language is a simplistic language, built entirely
of Java objects. Its main class is {@link Query}. A Query can look for data in
one data collection (e.g. a table in a relational database) at a time. Hence,
it is nowhere as flexible nor as powerful as e.g. SQL.</p>

<p>Queries are compiled using an implementation of the {link QueryTranslator}
interface, meaning that the data management is a black box towards the rest
of the Elis platform. Translators can be written to facilitate relational
databases, NoSQL databases, file-based storage or just whatever is desired by a
developer. It is also possible for a single Persistent Storage implementation
to provide several translators.</p>

<p>A query consists of {@link Predicate Predicates}, which can be of the
{@link SimplePredicate} type, providing functionality for value matching, or of
the {@link ChainingPredicate} type, providing functionality for combinational
matching. By chaining several ChainingPredicates, it is possible to build
rather complex queries.</p>

<p>Queries can, if they are simple select-type queries, be limited and
paginated using {@link Query# limit()}. It is also possible to choose the order
in which the result is ordered.</p>

<p>Building a query, one uses the various methods of Query. Since almost all
methods return a reference pointer back to the calling object, it is possible
to daisy chain the query calls, making things like the query below possible.

  <code>
    Query q = new Query();<br>
    q.setDataType("java.lang.String")<br>
      .setPredicate(new ChainingPredicate.OR<br>
      	.setLeft(new SimplePredicate.EQ("id", 5)<br>
      	.setRight(new SimplePredicate.LIKE("name","Lukas"))
      )
      .limit(100, 10);
  </code>
