 * <p>The ChainingPredicate interface describes a predicate used to link

 * levels of criteria used in the data filtering can be used. The
 * ChainingPredicate uses an internal binary structure, the branches named
 * "left" and "right". Each branch is executed separately, before being
 * compared to its neighbor.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As all interfaces extending Predicate, ChainingPredicate makes use of
 * self references for method chaining.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Every implementation of ChainingPredicate must include a reference to the
 * {@link ChainingPredicates} enumeration, publicly visible under the name
 * <i>Predicates</i>.</p>
