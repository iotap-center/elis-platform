What is this?

  The Device service component provides a way of accessing the devices in the
  Elis platform through the REST API, using the /devices/ endpoint.
  
How does it work?

  The endpoint services are annotated with Java's JAX-RS annotations. By doing
  so, the Elis platform's embedded Jersey server will then automatically
  recognize the exposed services as being web services and expose them to the
  outside world.
