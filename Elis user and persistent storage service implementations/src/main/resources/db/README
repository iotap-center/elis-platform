For the production environment we currently use a default user, called 'elis'. The user must have full access to the database called 'elis', which is created by running the production.sql script. The password for the *.elis.mah.se setup is found in the local setup document.

For the test environment to be operational, there must be a user called 'elis_test', identified by 'elis_test'. The user must have full access to the database called 'elis_test', which is created by running the test.sql script. This is the user that is used by default until the environment is set up correctly.
