For the production environment we currently use a static user. This means, that
there must be a user called 'elis', identified by the password
'notallthatsecret'. The user must have full access to the database called
'elis', which is created by running the production.sql script.

For the test environment to be operational, there must be a user called
'elis_test', identified by 'elis_test'. The user must have full access to the
database called 'elis_test', which is created by running the test.sql script.
